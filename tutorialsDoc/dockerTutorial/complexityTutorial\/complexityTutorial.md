# Complexity Tutorial

1. Complexity:
   - time complexity
   - resource complexity
2. `time complexity` answer the following question: If we need m peeks for an array of length n, how many peeks do we require for an array of length 2n?
3. Complexity formalized with the O notation
   - constant compl. O(1) : double n, no change
   - linear compl. O(n) : double n, double complexity
   - quadratic compl. O(n2): double n, four-fold complexity
   - logarithmic compl. O(log2 n): double n, complexity increases by 1
