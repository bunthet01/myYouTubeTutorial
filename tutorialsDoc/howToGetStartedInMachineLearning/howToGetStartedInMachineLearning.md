# How to get started in machine learning

    - Introduction about the purpose of this video
    - The idea is not to teach you step by step how to write code or analyse the machine learning problem. It is just to promote machine learning to Cambodian learners (That's why I speak in Khmer.)
    - This content are already covered in many YouTube video (In English)

## Introduction do machine learning

1. Not a professional in this field, just a student and practitioner
2. Mention about the video of AXK on Artificial Intelligence and link to the online course at Stanford.
3. Short introduction to machine learning

   - Difference between tradition programing and machine learning programming

   - Machine learning algorithms are often categorized:
     - Supervised Learning
     - Unsupervised Learning (Not covered here)
     - Reinforcement Learning (Not covered here)

## Which programing language to get started?

- We can code machine learning in any program (c, c++, python, java, javascript, R,Matlab etc )
- For beginner:
  - the language is
    - interpredted => multipurpose, muliplateform, easy to debug,
  - Python or R : a lot of , large community (good for debuging)

## prerequist?

- basic linear algebra and culculus (vector, derivation, )
- basic probability and statistic
- programing language(Python, R or Matlab)
  - Python: provide powerful machine learning tools (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Pytorch, Keras, TensorFlor, MatplotLib)
