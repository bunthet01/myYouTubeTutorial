# Classification Perfomance Metrics

1. Type of classifiers:
   1. Soft classifier
   2. Hard classifer
2. Metrics
   1. Error (minimizing)
      1. Binary cross entropy or cross entropy loss (minimizing BCE = maximizing accuracy)
      2. 
   2. Score (maximizing)
      1. Accuracy 
      2. F-score (F1-score, F2-score)
      3. Precision
      4. Recall or sensitivity 
      5. Specification 
3. Confusion matrix based metrics (used moost for testing to compare the performance between two model)
   1. Accuracy 
   2. F-score (F1-score, F2-score)
   3. Precision
   4. Recall or sensitivity 
   5. Specification
