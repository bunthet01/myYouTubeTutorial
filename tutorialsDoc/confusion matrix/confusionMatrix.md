# Confusion Matrix

- Confusion marrix (aka error matrix): is a table to visulise the performance of an algorith in a classification problem.
- each row: represents the intances in the predicted class.
- each column: represents the intances in the autual class.
- confusion => if the system is confusing between two classes.
- confusion matrix reports:

  - True Positive(TS)
  - True Negative(TN)
  - False Postive(FP)
  - False Negative(FN)

- For those 4 element:

  - The first letter: represent the corectness of the prediction
  - The second letter: represent the class that the model predict

- **Exercise**
  - Write the formular to find the number of the actual positive class and negative class sample from those 4 component.
  - Write the formular to find the number of sample that the model predicts as negative and positive.
  - Write the formular to find the number of sample that the model predict correctly and incorrectly.
